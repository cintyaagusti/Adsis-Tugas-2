			I'm currently enjoying reading Kiera Cass' books series, "The Selection". It is a romance-classic novel. 
		I used to read any genre, but now i think I'm more comfortable with a classic story. Feeling nostalgic,
		the atmosphere back then, and what it was like to live in the year of 60s, 70s, or else.
		<br><br>
			In this blog i'd like to share my thoughts and opinions about the book that i read. 
		Please note, that i won't put on a rating or a review. 
		And please do not ask me to suggest any books. Because i will just mention all the books that 
		i have read before, hehe.
		<br><br>
			So, that was a quiet simple explanation about this blog. Hope you enjoy!
