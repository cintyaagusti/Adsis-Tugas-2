		For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime.
		The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth.
		To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels.
		To live in the palace and compete for the heart of the gorgeous Prince Maxon.

		<br>But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare.
		It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her.
		Then America meets Prince Maxon.
		Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself—and realizes that
		the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.<br/>

		Thirty-five girls came to the palace to compete in the Selection.

		When she’s with Maxon, she’s swept up in their new and breathless romance,
		and can’t dream of being with anyone else.
		But whenever she sees Aspen standing guard around the palace,
		she is overcome with memories of the life they planned to share.
		With the group narrowed down to the Elite,
		the other girls are even more determined to win Maxon over—and time is running out for America to decide.<br/>
